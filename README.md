# Car License Plate Detection System in Parking Lot
## Goal: how to recoginize  quickly the vehicles license plate to reduce operating expenses and keep clients satisfied.

In the project, we use the dataset from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection) to collect the vehicle images where the number plate appears.This dataset contains 433 images with bounding box annotations of the car license plates within the image.

We use pre-train VGG16 and RESNET50 on the license plate dataset. This means reusing the weights in one or more layers from the pre-trained network models in a new model and  keeping the weights fixed. We also add some more news layer and  fine tuning them.
